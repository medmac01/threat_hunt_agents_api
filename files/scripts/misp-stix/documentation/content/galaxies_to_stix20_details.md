# MISP Galaxies to STIX 2.0 mapping

MISP galaxies are exported in `Attack Pattern`, `Course of Action`, `Malware`, `Threat Actor`, `Tool` or `Vulnerability` objects.

Sometimes 2 different Galaxies are mapped into the same STIX 2.0 object, the following examples don't show each Galaxy type, but only one for each resulting STIX object. If you want to see the complete mapping, the [MISP Galaxies to STIX 2.0 mapping summary](README.md#Galaxies-to-STIX-20-mapping) gives all the Galaxy types that are mapped into each STIX object type

Since not all the fields of the galaxies and their clusters are exported into STIX 2.0, the following examples are given with the fields that are exported only, if you want to have a look at the full definitions, you can visit the [MISP Galaxies repository](https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy).
