            "description": "Adversaries may clear or remove evidence of malicious network connections in order to clean up traces of their operations. Configuration settings as well as various artifacts that highlight connection history may be created on a system from behaviors that require network connections, such as [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) or [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133). Defenders may use these artifacts to monitor or otherwise analyze network connections created by adversaries.\n\nNetwork connection history may be stored in various locations on a system. For example, RDP connection history may be stored in Windows Registry values under (Citation: Microsoft RDP Removal):\n\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Default</code>\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Servers</code>\n\nWindows may also store information about recent RDP connections in files such as <code>C:\\Users\\\\%username%\\Documents\\Default.rdp</code> and `C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Terminal\nServer Client\\Cache\\`.(Citation: Moran RDPieces) Similarly, macOS and Linux hosts may store information highlighting connection history in system logs (such as those stored in `/Library/Logs` and/or `/var/log/`).(Citation: Apple Culprit Access)(Citation: FreeDesktop Journal)(Citation: Apple Unified Log Analysis Remote Login and Screen Sharing)\n\nMalicious network connections may also require changes to network configuration settings, such as [Disable or Modify System Firewall](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/004) or tampering to enable [Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090). Adversaries may delete or modify this data to conceal indicators and/or impede defensive analysis.",
