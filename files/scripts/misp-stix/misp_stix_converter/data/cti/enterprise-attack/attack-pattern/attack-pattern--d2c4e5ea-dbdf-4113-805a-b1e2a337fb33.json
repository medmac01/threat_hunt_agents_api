This may involve various actions, such as removing services, deleting executables, [Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112), [Plist File Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1647), or other methods of cleanup to prevent defenders from collecting evidence of their persistent presence.(Citation: Cylance Dust Storm)\n\nIn some instances, artifacts of persistence may also be removed once an adversary\u2019s persistence is executed in order to prevent errors with the new instance of the malware.(Citation: NCC Group Team9 June 2020)",
