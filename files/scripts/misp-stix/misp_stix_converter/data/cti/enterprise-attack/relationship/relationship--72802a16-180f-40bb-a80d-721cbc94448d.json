            "description": "The deletion of a new instance or virtual machine is a common part of operations within many cloud environments. Events should then not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities. For example, detecting a sequence of events such as the creation of an instance, mounting of a snapshot to that instance, and deletion of that instance by a new user account may indicate suspicious activity.\n\nIn AWS, CloudTrail logs capture the deletion of an instance in the\u00a0TerminateInstances\u00a0event, and in Azure the deletion of a VM may be captured in Azure activity logs.(Citation: AWS CloudTrail Search) (Citation: Azure Activity Logs) Google's Admin Activity audit logs within their Cloud Audit logs can be used to detect the usage of\u00a0gcloud compute instances delete\u00a0to delete a VM.(Citation: Cloud Audit Logs)",
