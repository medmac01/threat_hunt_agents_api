For each executable, [ThiefQuest](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0595) prepends a copy of itself to the beginning of the file. When the file is executed, the [ThiefQuest](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0595) code is executed first. [ThiefQuest](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0595) creates a hidden file, copies the original target executable to the file, then executes the new hidden file to maintain the appearance of normal behavior.
