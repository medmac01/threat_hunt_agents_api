Monitor for suspicious sequences of events, such as the deletion of multiple snapshots within a short period of time. To reduce false positives, valid change management procedures could introduce a known identifier that is logged with the change (e.g., tag or header) if supported by the cloud provider, to help distinguish valid, expected actions from malicious ones.",
