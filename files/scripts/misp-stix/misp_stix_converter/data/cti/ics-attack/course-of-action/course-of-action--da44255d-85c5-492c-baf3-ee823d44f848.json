A SIS will typically include sensors, logic solvers, and a final control element that can be used to automatically respond to an hazardous condition  (Citation: A G Foord, W G Gulland, C R Howard, T Kellacher, W H Smith 2004) . Ensure that all SISs are segmented from operational networks to prevent them from being targeted by additional adversarial behavior.",
