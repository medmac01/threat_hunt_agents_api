            "description": "[ALLANITE](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1000) is a suspected Russian cyber espionage group, that has primarily targeted the electric utility sector within the United States and United Kingdom. The group's tactics and techniques are reportedly similar to [Dragonfly](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0035), although [ALLANITE](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1000)s technical capabilities have not exhibited disruptive or destructive abilities. It has been suggested that the group maintains a presence in ICS for the purpose of gaining understanding of processes and to maintain persistence. (Citation: Dragos)",
