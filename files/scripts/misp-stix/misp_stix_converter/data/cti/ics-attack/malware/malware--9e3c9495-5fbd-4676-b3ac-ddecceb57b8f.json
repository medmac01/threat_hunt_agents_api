            "description": "[EKANS](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0017) is ransomware that was first seen December 2019 and later reported to have impacted operations at Honda automotive production facilities.(Citation: Forbes Snake Ransomware June 2020)(Citation: MalwareByes Honda and Enel Ransomware June 2020)(Citation: Dragos EKANS February 2020) EKANS has a hard-coded kill-list of processes, including some associated with common ICS software platforms (e.g., GE Proficy historian, Honeywell HMIWeb).(Citation: Dragos EKANS February 2020) If the malware discovers these processes on the target system, it will stop, encrypt, and rename the process to prevent the program from restarting. This malware should not be confused with the \u201cSnake\u201d malware associated with the Turla group. The ICS processes documented within the malware\u2019s kill-list is similar to those defined by the MEGACORTEX software.(Citation: FireEye OT Ransomware July 2020)(Citation: Pylos January 2020)(Citation: Dragos EKANS June 2020)The ransomware was initially reported as \u201cSnake\u201d, however, to avoid confusion with the unrelated Turla APT group security researchers spelled it backwards as EKANS.",
