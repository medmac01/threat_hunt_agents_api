Provide defense-in-depth by implementing authenticity within the associated application-layer protocol, or through a network-layer VPN. (Citation: CISA March 2010)  Furthermore, ensure communication schemes provide strong replay protection, employing techniques such as timestamps or cryptographic nonces.\n",
