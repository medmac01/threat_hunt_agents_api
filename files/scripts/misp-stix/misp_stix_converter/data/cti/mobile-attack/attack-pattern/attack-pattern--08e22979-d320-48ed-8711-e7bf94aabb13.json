By doing this, the adversary can effectively redirect device traffic to wherever they want. However, registering as a VPN client requires user consent on both Android and iOS. Additionally, on iOS, the application requires a special entitlement that must be granted by Apple. Alternatively, if an application is able to escalate privileges, it can potentially utilize those privileges to gain access to network traffic.  \n\n \n\nOutside of a mobile device, adversaries may be able to capture traffic by employing a rogue base station or Wi-Fi access point. These devices will allow adversaries to capture network traffic after it has left the device, while it is flowing to its destination. On a local network, enterprise techniques could be used, such as DNS redirection or DNS poisoning.  \n\n \n\nIf applications properly encrypt their network traffic, sensitive data may not be accessible an adversary, depending on the point of capture.

These applications should be heavily scrutinized since VPN functionality is not very common. Mobile security products can potentially detect rogue Wi-Fi access points if the adversary is attempting to decrypt traffic using an untrusted SSL certificate. \n\n \n\nOn both Android and iOS, users must grant consent to an application to act as a VPN. Both platforms also provide visual context to the user in the top status bar when a VPN connection is active. Users can see registered VPN services in the device settings. ",
