This technique is primarily used to evade static analysis checks and pre-publication scans in official app stores. In some cases, more advanced dynamic or behavioral analysis techniques could detect this behavior. However, in conjunction with [Execution Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1627) techniques, detecting malicious code downloaded after installation could be difficult.\n\nOn Android, dynamic code could include native code, Dalvik code, or JavaScript code that utilizes Android WebView\u2019s `JavascriptInterface` capability. \n\nOn iOS, dynamic code could be downloaded and executed through 3rd party libraries such as JSPatch.

Mobile security products may provide URL inspection services that could determine if a domain being visited is malicious. Application vetting services could look for indications that the application downloads and executes new code at runtime (e.g., on Android, use of `DexClassLoader`, `System.load`, or the WebView `JavaScriptInterface` capability; on iOS, use of JSPatch or similar capabilities). Unfortunately, this is only a partial mitigation, as additional scrutiny would still need to be applied to applications that use these techniques. These techniques are often used without malicious intent, and  applications may employ other techniques to hide their use of these techniques.",
