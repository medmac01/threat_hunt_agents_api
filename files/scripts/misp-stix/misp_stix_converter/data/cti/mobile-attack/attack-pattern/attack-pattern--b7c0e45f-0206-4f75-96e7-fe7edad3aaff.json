            "description": "Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses or even elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. \n\nBoth Android and iOS have no legitimate way to achieve process injection. The only way this is possible is by abusing existing root access or exploiting a vulnerability.",
