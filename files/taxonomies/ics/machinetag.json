Devices are linked in either a daisy-chain or star (or some combination) configuration with up to 20 m of shielded 24-conductor cable. A maximum separation of 4 m is specified between any two devices, and an average of 2m over the entire bus.  The data transfer rate can be up to 1 Mbyte/s.

Firewire frames are 125 msec long which means that despite a 'headline' transfer speed of 400 Mbit/s Firewire can be substantially slower in responding to instruments' service requests.  Firewire uses a peer-peer protocol, similar to IEEE-488. Using standard cable, the maximum length bus comprises 16 hops of 4.5m each. Each hop connects two devices, but each physical device can contain four logical nodes. A Firewire cable contains two twisted-pairs (signals and clock) and two untwisted conductors (power and ground)."

Individual devices can use the bus for a maximum of 50% of the time. In practice, the maximum rate is not more than 0.6 Mbyte/s.  USB 2.0 specification was released in 2000. In addition to increasing the signaling rate from 12 MHz to 480 MHz, the specification describes a more advanced feature set and uses bandwidth more efficiently than 'Classic' USB.
